# Large-Scale-Data-Management
This course from my MSc in Data Science contains an analysis of data from Zillow which is a dataset including ~100K listings from the BOSTON, MA area related to house characteristics. UDF in Pyspark to process data was developed. Also, the operations in Pyspark were used in MonetDB.
